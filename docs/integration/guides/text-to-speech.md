In this guide, I will show you how to setup a service call that can call a SIP endpoint, say something and hangup.

## Requirements

For this guide you will need the following:

- Googletts
    - Preinstalled in the add-on
    - If your not using the add-on, you can install it <a href="https://zaf.github.io/asterisk-googletts">here</a>.
- Asterisk integration installed

## Dialplan

First, let's make a dialplan extension.

```editorconfig title="extensions.conf"
[speech]                                       ; The context
exten => 123,1,Answer()                        ; Answer the call
exten => 123,n,agi(googletts.agi,"${TEXT}",en) ; Execute the googletts agi script with the TEXT variable
```

## Service

```yaml title="Service"
service: asterisk.send_action
data:
    action: Originate
    parameters:
        channel: PJSIP/100            # The device it will call
        context: speech               # The context we created in the dialplan
        exten: '123'                  # The extension inside that context
        priority: '1'                 # Priority of the call
        caller_id: 'Home Assistant'   # The callerID it calls as
        timeout: 60                   # Time until giving up
        variables: TEXT: Hello world! # Variables that you can use in the dialplan
```
