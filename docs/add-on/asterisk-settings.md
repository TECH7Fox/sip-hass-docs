# üõ†Ô∏è Asterisk Settings

The add-on allows you to fully configure the Asterisk configuration files.

You can find the configuration files in `/addon_configs/3e533915_asterisk/asterisk/`.
Here you will find the `custom` and `default` folders.

The `default` folder contains the default configuration files, which are generated by the add-on and Asterisk.
This folder will be overwritten every time the add-on is restarted or updated.

The `custom` folder contains the custom configuration files, which will override the default configuration files.
This allows you to customize specific parts of the configuration while still having the preconfigured parts and updated configurations from Asterisk.

So in order to change a configuration file, you can copy the file from the `default` folder to the `custom` folder and edit it there.
Now after a restart of the add-on, the custom configuration will be used instead of the default configuration.

## üìö Documentation

We recommend reading the [voip-info.org Asterisk documentation](https://www.voip-info.org/asterisk/)
to understand the possibilities of Asterisk and how to configure it.

They also have great examples and guides for specific use cases.
