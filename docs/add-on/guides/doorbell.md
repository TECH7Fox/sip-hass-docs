If you have a SIP doorbell, you can connect it to the add-on.

## Requirements

For this guide you will need the following:

- Working Add-on
- Doorbell or other SIP device

## Create PJSIP contact

First, create a extension for your device in `pjsip_custom.conf`.

```editorconfig title="pjsip_custom.conf"
[8000]
type = endpoint
context = default
disallow = all
allow = alaw,ulaw          ; Audio codecs
allow=h264                 ; Video codecs
direct_media_method=invite
dtmf_mode=info
callerid="Doorbell" <8000>
force_rport=no
aors= 8000
auth = auth8000

[8000]
type = aor
max_contacts = 1

[auth8000]
type=auth
auth_type=userpass
password=mypassword        ; Set your password here
username=8000
```

:::caution

Depending on your devices, you might want to change the codecs.

:::

Restart the add-on, and check the logs if the doorbell registers.

## Dialplan

Now we need to choose and configure a dialplan to send the call to the right place. This could be complicated depending on if you have a 24/7 registered extension.

The dialplan is set in `extensions.conf`.

### Dial

If you do have a device which is always registered to accept incoming calls, you can use the normal **Dial** function.

The add-on already has a default dialplan extension that calls the extension your trying to reach.

```editorconfig title="extensions.conf"
exten => _X!,1,Dial(${PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS(${EXTEN})})
```

You can also dial to multiple devices, and it will connect to the first one to pickup.

More info about dial <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+13+Application_Dial">here</a>.

:::caution

This only works if the device your calling is registered.

:::

### Parking

With parking, the doorbell parks itself and wait for the other to retrieve the call.
The add-on includes a parking extension by default, so you only need to point to it.

Simply use it by calling `444` to park, and `555` to pickup a parked call.

You can find more info about parking <a href="../parking/">here</a>.

### Conference

By using a conference the doorbell also waits for someone else to join the conference room. For this you also need to configure a conference room and users in `confbridge.conf`.

:::tip

This option allows calling with **multiple devices**. So more then one person can answer the doorbell. 

:::

```editorconfig title="confbridge.conf"
[admin_user]
type=user
marked=yes
admin=yes
music_on_hold_when_empty=yes
quiet=yes

[default_user]
type=user
wait_marked=yes
end_marked=yes
music_on_hold_when_empty=yes
quiet=yes

[myconferenceroom]
type=bridge
max_members=10
```

Then call the room with the correct user from the dialplan.

```editorconfig title="extensions.conf"
; for the doorbell
exten => 777,1,Progress()
exten => 777,2,Wait(1)
exten => 777,3,ConfBridge(1,myconferenceroom,default_user)

; for the other user
exten => 888,1,Progress()
exten => 888,2,Wait(1)
exten => 888,3,ConfBridge(1,myconferenceroom,admin_user)
```

Look <a href="https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/ConfBridge+Configuration">here</a> for all the conference settings.

### Redial

This is a bit more complicated dialplan, but basicly it tries to call, and if it hangsup because the endpoint isn't registered it tries again after 1 second. And it keeps trying until it tried 60 times.

When dialing, you can use the asterisk integration to trigger a automation that sends a notification to your phone to open the sip card.

Compared to the park method, this way all endpoints keep ringing. Which could be quite useful if you have a ring group. This also makes this method very useful for if you want to call both the sip cards and softphones.

Feel free to tweak the wait time between tries or the amount of tries. And adjust the Dial function for your endpoints.

```editorconfig title="extensions.conf"
exten => s,1,NoOp() 
 same => n,Set(COUNT=1)
 same => n,While($[ ${COUNT} < 60 ])
 same => n,Set(DIALGROUP(mygroup,add)=PJSIP/6001) 
 same => n,Set(DIALGROUP(mygroup,add)=PJSIP/100) 
 same => n,Dial(${DIALGROUP(mygroup)},60)
 same => n,Set(HANGUPCAUSEKEYS=${HANGUPCAUSE_KEYS()})
 same => n,Set(HANGUP_CAUSE=${HANGUPCAUSE})
 same => n,GotoIf($["${HANGUP_CAUSE}" == "21"]?exitdialplan)
 same => n,GotoIf($["${HANGUP_CAUSE}" == "0"]?exitdialplan)  
 same => n,Wait(1) 
 same => n,SET(COUNT=$[${COUNT} + 1]
 same => n,EndWhile()
 same => n,Verbose(2, HANGUP_CAUSE=${HANGUPCAUSE})
 same => n(exitdialplan),NoOp(Exiting dialplan: HANGUP_CAUSE=${HANGUPCAUSE}) 
 same => n,Hangup()
 ```

A similar function is the **RetryDial** function.

`wait.wav` is the waiting music.
`4` is the seconds between each try.
`10` is the amount of tries.

```editorconfig title="extensions.conf"
exten => 777,1,Progress()
exten => 777,n,RetryDial(wait.wav,4,10,PJSIP/100) 
```

### Redial Until Answer

Here is another redial example that keeps trying until someone answers and hangs up.

```editorconfig title="extensions.conf"
exten => 8002,1,Ringing() ; ghost extension number used only for the purpose of redirect, there is no trunk in sip/psjip.conf , this is setup on your VTO config.
exten => 8002,n(dialing),Dial(${PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS(100)}& ${PJSIP_DIAL_CONTACTS(104)}) ;this is so you can dial multiple extensions.
exten => 8002,n(busy),Playtones(dial) ;the call connects and custom sound is played, but we make it sound the same with the dial ringtone
exten => 8002,n,Goto(dialing) ; then it repeats itself
exten => 8002,n,HangUp()
```

So when somebody pushes the doorbell but none of the dashboard are connected, it will keep dialing untill someone answers.
Like this you can open the home assistant after a notification and see the incoming call on multiple dashboards, first come, first served.

You cannot close the connection unless you answer the call and then hangup.
