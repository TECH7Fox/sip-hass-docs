# SIP Core & Cards

Now we have a PBX to connect to, we can install the cards.

:::warning

The card only works in HTTPS. This is required by modern browsers to send your mic/cam trough.
You can use something like **DuckDNS** or **Let's Encrypt**.

:::

## Installation

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="install-method">
  <TabItem value="hacs" label="HACS" default>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <b>HACS</b></li>
      <li>Click on <b>Frontend</b></li>
      <li>Click on the 3 points in the upper right corner and click on <b>Custom repositories</b></li>
      <li>Paste <code>https://github.com/TECH7Fox/sip-hass-card</code> into <b>Add custom repository URL</b> and by category choose <b>Lovelace</b></li>
      <li>Click on add and check if the repository is there.</li>
      <li>You should now see <b>SIP Client</b>. Click <b>INSTALL</b></li>
    </ol>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the [latest **stable** release on github](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/sip-hass-card/releases).</li>
      <li>Copy <code>sipjs-card.js</code> to <code>/config/www/</code>.</li>
      <li>Add <code>sipjs-card.js</code> to resources.</li>
    </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure SIP Core

Now that we have SIP Core installed, we need to configure it.

1. In `/config/www/`, create a file called `sip-config.json`.
2. Copy the settings template from below into it.

<details>
<summary>Settings Template</summary>

```json title="Complete SIP Core Configuration"
{
    "ice_config": {
        "iceGatheringTimeout": 1000,
        "iceCandidatePoolSize": 0,
        "iceTransportPolicy": "all",
        "iceServers": [
            {
                "urls": ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"]
            }
        ],
        "rtcpMuxPolicy": "require"
    },
    "backup_user": {
        "ha_username": "myusername",
        "extension": "100",
        "password": "mypassword"
    },
    "users": [
        {
            "ha_username": "myusername",
            "extension": "100",
            "password": "mypassword"
        }
    ],
    "sip_video": false,
    "auto_answer": false,
    "popup_config": {
        "auto_open": true,
        "large": false,
        "buttons": [],
        "extensions": {}
    }
}
```

</details>

3. Change `myusername`, `extension` and `mypassword` with your own Home Assistant username, SIP extension, and the password that you set in the add-on settings.

:::info

You can find the Home Assistant **usernames** in Settings > People > Users.

:::

4. Save the file.

5. Reload your browser (use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>) to make sure the new configuration is loaded.

6. (Optional) Adjust other options like `auto_answer` or `popup_config` as needed.  
See the [Settings documentation](../card/settings.md) for all available options and examples.

## Add the Card(s)

Now that SIP Core is configured, you can add cards to your dashboard to make and receive calls.

### üìá Contacts Card

The **Contacts Card** shows a list of SIP endpoints (extensions) and lets you call them with a single click.

```yaml title="Example: Contacts Card"
type: custom:sip-contacts-card
extensions:
  "102":
    name: Jordy
    status_entity: binary_sensor.100_registered
    override_icon: mdi:account
  "103":
    name: Desk phone
    override_icon: mdi:deskphone
  "8001":
    name: Doorbell
    override_icon: mdi:doorbell-video
  "0612345678":
    name: Test
    override_icon: mdi:dialpad
    edit: true
debug: false
hide_me: false
state_color: true
```

See the [Contacts Card documentation](../card/cards-popups/contacts-card.md) for all options and features.

---

### üìû Call Card (Optional)

The **Call Card** provides a full call interface directly in your dashboard, including call controls, video, and custom buttons.

```yaml title="Example: Call Card"
type: custom:sip-call-card
extensions:
  "101":
    name: Jordy
  "102":
    name: Desk Phone
    override_icon: mdi:deskphone
  "8001":
    name: Doorbell
    camera_entity: camera.doorbell
buttons:
  - label: Open Door
    icon: mdi:door-open
    type: service_call
    data:
      domain: light
      service: toggle
      entity_id: light.bedroom_lights
  - label: DTMF 1
    icon: mdi:1
    type: dtmf
    data:
      dtmf: "1"
```

See the [Call Card documentation](../card/cards-popups/call-card.md) for all options and features.

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Cards

You can also create your own custom cards and popups to fit your needs.  
See the [developer documentation](../developers/card/introduction.md) for guides and examples on building your own SIP Core components.

## SSL

**WSS** (Secure WebSocket) requires **SSL** for security reasons. The add-on sets up Asterisk's part of that, but you may still need to set up your network to work with it.

<Tabs groupId="ssl-method">
  <TabItem value="ingress" label="Ingress (Recommended)" default>
    <b>Ingress</b> is the easiest and most secure way to use SIP Core with the Asterisk add-on.<br/>
    Home Assistant tunnels the WebSocket connection through its own secure connection, so you don't need to set up SSL or port forwarding in Asterisk.

    - No need to open ports or manage certificates.
    - Works out of the box with the add-on and SIP Core.
    - Just use the default settings and let Home Assistant and SIP Core handle the rest.

    :::tip
    If you use the Asterisk add-on, Ingress is enabled by default.  
    For technical details, see the <a href="/docs/developers/add-on/ingress">developer docs</a>.
    :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">
    You can temporarily accept the certificate manually by going to:<br/>
    <code>https://&lt;YOUR-HA-ADDRESS&gt;:8089/ws</code>, click continue and accept. You should see <b>Upgrade Required</b>.

    Now your browser accepts this certificate, even if the domain doesn't match.

    :::warning
    This is only to temporarily test. This only works for a limited time and doesn't work for other devices.

    <b>This is not a permanent solution!</b>
    :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dns" label="DNS Rewrite">
    It's possible to set a <b>DNS rewrite</b> in your router, so your certificate domain points towards your <b>local IP</b>.  
    This way you don't have to port forward anything, but this only works locally.

    - Set up a DNS rewrite so your domain resolves to your Home Assistant's local IP.
    - Your browser will trust the certificate if the domain matches.

    You can find more info <a href="../add-on/guides/dns_rewrite">here</a>.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="portforward" label="Port Forwarding">
    The classic way is to port forward <code>8089</code>.  
    Then you can set the <code>server</code> option to your domain.  
    You may also need to forward the <b>RTP ports</b>, which are by default <code>10000-20000</code>.

    :::caution
    If you do this, make sure you have <b>secure passwords</b> for your extensions! Bots may try to brute-force it.

    If that happens often, you could set <code>8089</code> to another non-standard port.
