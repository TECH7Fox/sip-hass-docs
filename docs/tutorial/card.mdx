## Configuration

- In edit mode, click on add card.
- Search for **SIP Card**.

Now we need to configure it.

:::tip

Most things are configurable from the editor, except for the **ICE settings**.
We recommend using the **card editor** for all other settings.

:::

```yaml title="card configuration"
type: 'custom:sipjs-card'
server: 'your-local-ip'                     # Set your local HA IP here!
port: '8089'                                # WSS default is 8089.
video: false                                # Send and receive video. Can require extra configuration.
auto_answer: false                          # Auto-answer when called.
hide_me: false                              # Hide the extension your registered as.
state_color: true                           # Show the set entity state in the icon.
custom_title: ''
ringtone: /local/asterisk/ringtone.mp3      # Optional, this points to /www/asterisk/ringtone.mp3
ringbacktone: /local/asterisk/backtone.mp3  # Optional, this points to /www/asterisk/backtone.mp3
button_size: 42
extensions:                                 # Set here the WSS extensions you can register as.
  - person: person.person1                  # Your first person entity here
    name: Person1
    extension: '100'
    secret: 'your-auto-generated-secret'    # Set the auto_generated_secret you set in the add-on here!
    icon: mdi:monitor
    entity: binary_sensor.sensor1
    camera: ''
  - person: person.person2                  # Your second person entity here
    name: Person2
    extension: '101'
    secret: 'your-auto-generated-secret'    # Set the auto_generated_secret you set in the add-on here!
    icon: mdi:monitor
    entity: binary_sensor.sensor1
    camera: ''
```

Now you might get a `9006` error. That's because the certificate doesn't match the domain. (in this case the server option)

So now we need to fix **SSL**.

## SSL

**WSS** requires **SSL** for security reason. The add-on set's up Asterisk's part of that, but you still need to setup your network to work with it.

### Manual

You can temporary accept the certificate manually by going to `https://<YOUR-HA-ADDRESS>:8089/ws`, click continue and accept. You should see `Upgrade Required`.

Now your browser accepts this certificate, even if the domain doesn't match.

:::warning

Warning! This only works for a couple days max. When the certificate changes you have to do this again.

**This is not a permanent solution!**

:::

### Port Forwarding

Best way is to port forward `8089`. Then you can set the `server` option to your domain. But then you also need to forward the **RTP ports**, which is by default `10000-20000`.

:::caution

If you do this, make sure you have **secure passwords** for your extensions! Bot's may try to brute-force it.

If that happens often, you could set `8089` to another non-standard port.

:::

### DNS Rewrite

It's possible to set a **DNS rewrite** in your router, so your certificate domain points towards your **local IP**. This way you don't have to port forward anything, but this only works locally.
