Here is everything you need to setup developing for the add-on. Thank you for your help with this project!

## About

The Asterisk add-on is a docker container for Home Assistant that set's up a Asterisk server and configures it to use with the card.

## How to Test

You can test the add-on on your Home Assistant to make sure it works.

- Comment out the `image` option in `config.yaml`.

```yaml title="config.yaml" {6-6}
name: Asterisk
version: 1.3.2
slug: asterisk
description: PBX server for SIP devices like doorbells and phones
url: https://github.com/TECH7Fox/Asterisk-add-on
#image: "ghcr.io/tech7fox/{arch}-addon-asterisk"
arch:
  - armhf
  - armv7
  - aarch64
  - amd64
  - i386
``` 

- Copy the `Asterisk` folder to `/addons`.
- Reload the repositories and install the add-on.

## Running locally with Docker

The repository contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used to locally build and run a standalone version of the add-on.

- Copy the example `json` configuration file and set your own values:
  ```bash
  mkdir config
  cp ./rootfs/etc/asterisk-addon/default_config.json asterisk/config.json
  ```
- Set `HA_TOKEN` and `HA_URL` environment variables in docker-compose.yml
- Build a Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker-compose build asterisk
  ```
- Run the built image:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up asterisk
  ```
- If you want to easily edit and test the scripts without having to rebuild the whole image, you can mount the local files from the project directory in the container. 
See the `volumes:` section for examples.
